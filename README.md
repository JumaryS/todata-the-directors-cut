# This is not easy 

### Goal
1. Create a To-do list that works
2. Don't copy from your fellows
3. Ask teachers for toggle help
 


### What Does That Entail?

Ive started over from scratch using DOM manipulation to create a fully functional to-do app

No NPM test needed

### HTML 

HTML is important to help build an outline for your app. We will start by giving names to certain div families. These class names will later be called upon when we use DOM manipulation. 

What is DOM?

## DOM
What is DOM manipulation in JavaScript?
The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.


## HOW DOES DOM WORK?

It allows a language (JavaScript) to manipulate, structure, and style your website. After the browser reads your HTML document, it creates a representational tree called the Document Object Model and defines how that tree can be accessed.

### Some Problems You'll Have To Solve

* How can we toggle the completeness of a todo by clicking on it?
* How can we change the text of the buttons that are toggling? For example, when we click "Show Priorities", it changes to "Hide Priorities" so that we can toggle that feature back off.
* How can we access the pulldown menu for adding priority to a todo?


### An Important Guideline:

You should be using INLINE functions for your event listeners. No more having to make (and name!) helper functions.
