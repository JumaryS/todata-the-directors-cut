# Todata - The Director's Cut

There are three main ways we could extend Todata.

1. Give it a good README.
2. Upgrade its functionality.
3. Make it beautiful.


### README

This is our absolute first priority with this project. This is what you will be presenting FIRST in your presentations on Monday.

The reason is that it's time we started focusing on the polish of our apps. And as (currently) solo developers, your apps are first and foremost demonstrations of your ability.

Whatever the state of your projects, be they just started or ready to deploy, they will be much more attractive packages with full documentation. It shows that you think deeply about what you're doing and can explain it succinctly. And if you can't explain it succinctly... well, it's time to start practicing!

Here's what your README should include:
1. A screenshot of the app. (Feel free to update this if you change its look!
2. The app's features from a user perspective.
3. What tools and techniques you used.
4. Which of those tools were new to you.
5. Where the app is hosted.

For hosting the app, use one of the following methods:
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Has the advantage that every time you push to GH, it will (with some delay) update the hosted page using your changes.
* [Surge](https://surge.sh/). My personal favorite, as setup is easy and you can do it with one command from the command line.

Some good resources on what makes a good README in larger projects (including the ones you'll build later this term):

* An article about [what makes a good README for an open-source project](https://dev.to/scottydocs/how-to-write-a-kickass-readme-5af9#template). It also has a great README template.
* This one is just [another good README template](https://gist.github.com/fvcproductions/1bfc2d4aecb01a834b46).
* [README Driven Development](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) - A short manifesto for writing the README as the very first thing.
